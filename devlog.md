This project looks somewhat intimidating to me
The stuff related to B-trees is fine, there are plenty of tools to visualize insertion operations for reference
The part that looks tricky is working with blocks of memory
I'm not very experienced in working with raw binary data in a structured way, so I expect that to pose difficulty
I'll be doing the project in Python since Python worked well for project 2
I'll try to have everything in a single main.py file, but I may break things apart if it would be useful

My goal for this first session is to be able to print the provided index file
While I'm at it, I may as well also implement extract since it should be very similar
And in doing that, I would need to be able to read commands
And if I'm reading commands already, it shouldn't be too hard to implement create
I don't know how difficult it will be to implement print, so I don't know if I'll achieve it this session
Part of this session will be exploratory as I figure out how to approach the problem
